I am currently a visiting student at the Raman Research Institute-Bengaluru, for a period of 6 months at the Cell Biophysics lab (Supervisor: Dr Pramod Pullarkat) in the Soft Condensed Matter department. (insert current work here). I want to use theoretical/computational tools to study biophysical systems. My research interests broadly lies in cellular mechanobiology and membrane biophysics. I am also interested in learning the experimental approaches to problems in mechanobiology.

Prior to this, I graduated with a BS-MS dual degree majoring in physics in July 2022, from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research(IISER)-Kolkata. My Master's project was on Simulating the Unruh effect with quantum walks, supervised by Dr CM Chandrashekar at the Indian Institute of Science(IISc)-Bengaluru. My ![CV](/myresume.pdf) has more details on my previous experiences.
